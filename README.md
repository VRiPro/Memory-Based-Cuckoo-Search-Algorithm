# Memory-Based-Cuckoo-Search-Algorithm
**A Python implementation for minimizing energy consumption in Robotic Mixed-Model Assembly Lines using a Memory-Based Cuckoo Search Algorithm.**

### Based on the article:
[Solving the energy-efficient Robotic Mixed-Model Assembly Line balancing problem using a Memory-Based Cuckoo Search Algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197622002494?via%3Dihub)

## How to define the parameters of your "Robotic Mixed-Model Assembly Line":

1. **Create your .xlsx file**: Write down all parameters that define your case in Excel. (Some examples [here]([https://www.google.com](https://github.com/VRiPro/Memory-Based-Cuckoo-Search-Algorithm/blob/main/MBCSA.py))). Name your file `DonnéesX.xlsx`, where `X` is a number (e.g., `Données3.xlsx`, `Données15.xlsx`).

    - **Sheet 1: Equipment and Energy Consumption**
        - Define the equipment.
        - Define the energy consumption for each task and the standby energy for each robot.

    - **Sheet 2: Task Precedence**
        - Setup the precedence of your Mixed-Model.
        - Example: A `1` in the cell (column "1", row "3") means that task "3" must wait for task "1" to complete before starting.

## How to solve your problem:

1. **Execute the Python script**: Make sure your .xlsx file and .py file are in the same directory. After executing the code, a new window will open:

2. **Input the hyperparameters of the Memory-Based-Cuckoo-Search-Algorithm**: For better results, refer to the article. Defaults are suitable for small problems (e.g., Données1.xlsx to Données4.xlsx).

    **/!\ The only cell you should pay attention to is "Numero du Probleme".** The number must match the `X` in `DonnéesX.xlsx`.

    Click on "Lancer l'algorithme" to start the script.

3. **Results**: Access your solutions in the file "Résultat.xlsx".

    - **Robots**: Indicates the robot assigned to each workshop.
    - **NbTaches**: Shows how many tasks are assigned to each workshop.
    - **Ordonnancement**: Task scheduling order. 
    - **Fitness**: Energy consumption of your solution.
    - **CycleTime**: Cycle time of your solution.
    - **Calculation Time**: Time taken to compute the solution.

    In the figure, you can see 10 different solutions.

    - **Solution "0"**: This shows that workshops 1 & 2 should use robot 1, and workshop 3 should use robot 2. Additionally, it indicates that each workshop is assigned 4 tasks to complete.
